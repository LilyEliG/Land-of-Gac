Hi! My name is Lily Eli Goloh and this is my input adventure game called Land of Gac. To have more information on the game and your goals, consult the GackWorld.java file
# Land of Gac Game

This is a Java-based game project called "Land of Gac". Follow the instructions below to set up and run the game on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before running the game, you need to have the following installed on your system:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Installing JDK

1. Visit the [Oracle JDK Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) page.
2. Download the appropriate JDK installer for your operating system.
3. Follow the installation instructions provided by the installer.

### Installing Git

1. Visit the [Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) page.
2. Download and install the Git package for your operating system.

## Setting up the Project

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project using the `cd` command.
3. Clone the repository by running the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/LilyEliG/Land-of-Gac.git
```

This will create a local copy of the project on your machine.

## Running the Game

1. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd Land-of-Gac
```

2. Compile the Java files by running the following command:

```
javac src/main/java/com/example/*.java
```

Note: Replace `com/example` with the actual package structure of your project.

3. Run the main class file `Game.java` using the following command:

```
java com.example.Game
```

Again, replace `com.example` with the package structure of your project, and `Game` with the name of the main class file containing the `main()` method.
